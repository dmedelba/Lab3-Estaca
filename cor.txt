to mrs saville england
st petersburgh dec th 
you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the
commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil
forebodings  i arrived here yesterday and my first task is to assure
my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success
of my undertaking
i am already far north of london and as i walk in the streets of
petersburgh i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks which
braces my nerves and fills me with delight  do you understand this
feeling  this breeze which has travelled from the regions towards
which i am advancing gives me a foretaste of those icy climes
inspirited by this wind of promise my daydreams become more fervent
and vivid  i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of
frost and desolation it ever presents itself to my imagination as the
region of beauty and delight  there margaret the sun is for ever
visible its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a
perpetual splendour  therefor with your leave my sister i will put
some trust in preceding navigatorsthere snow and frost are banished
and sailing over a calm sea we may be wafted to a land surpassing in
wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable
globe  its productions and features may be without example as the
phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered
solitudes  what may not be expected in a country of eternal light  i
may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may
regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this
voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever  i
shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world
never before visited and may tread a land never before imprinted by
the foot of man these are my enticements and they are sufficient to
conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this
laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little
boat with his holiday mates on an expedition of discovery up his
native river but supposing all these conjectures to be false you
cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all
mankind to the last generation by discovering a passage near the pole
to those countries to reach which at present so many months are
requisite or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet which if at
all possible can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine
these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my
letter and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me
to heaven for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as
a steady purposea point on which the soul may fix its intellectual
eye  this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years i
have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have
been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean
through the seas which surround the pole  you may remember that a
history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the
whole of our good uncle thomas library  my education was neglected
yet i was passionately fond of reading  these volumes were my study
